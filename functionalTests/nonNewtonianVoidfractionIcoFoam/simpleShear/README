This test case is a simple example to verify to non-newtonian 
implementation in CFDEM

This test case can be simply run by launching "regression.sh" from the
main directory of the case.

This will carry a regression analysis of the viscosity versus the voidfraction and this will be compared with the analytical model

Perfect fit is obtained even for very coarse mesh since the velocity profile at steady-state is linear.
